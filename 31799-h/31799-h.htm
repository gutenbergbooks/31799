<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Loosely</span> joined together as regards literary
form, the following notes are, in reality, the
outcome of convictions long held and slowly matured.</p>

<p>In them a problem of the first magnitude is
formulated with apparent simplicity, without giving
the key to its final solution; for the problem
cannot be solved for generations&mdash;if at all.</p>

<p>But it involves an innumerable series of lesser
problems, which I present to the consideration of
those whom they may concern. For it is a long
time since any one has devoted himself to earnest
musical research.</p>

<p>It is true, that admirable works of genius arise
in every period, and I have always taken my stand
in the front rank of those who joyfully acclaimed
the passing standard-bearers; and still it seems to
me that of all these beautiful paths leading so far
afield&mdash;none lead <em>upward</em>.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_2" title="2"> </a>
<i>The spirit of an art-work, the measure of emotion,
of humanity, that is in it&mdash;these remain unchanged in
value through changing years; the form which these
three assumed, the manner of their expression, and the
flavor of the epoch which gave them birth, are transient,
and age rapidly.</i></p>

<p>Spirit and emotion retain their essence, in the
art-work as in man himself; we admire technical
achievements, yet they are outstripped, or cloy the
taste and are discarded.</p>

<p>Its ephemeral qualities give a work the stamp
of &ldquo;modernity;&rdquo; its unchangeable essence hinders
it from becoming &ldquo;obsolete.&rdquo; Among both &ldquo;modern&rdquo;
and &ldquo;old&rdquo; works we find good and bad,
genuine and spurious. There is nothing properly
modern&mdash;only things which have come into being
earlier or later; longer in bloom, or sooner withered.
The Modern and the Old have always been.</p>

<div class="description">CHARACTERIZATION OF THE ARTS</div>

<p>Art-forms are the more lasting, the more closely
they adhere to the nature of their individual
species of art, the purer they keep their essential
means and ends.</p>

<p>Sculpture relinquishes the expression of the
human pupil, and effects of color; painting degenerates,
when it forsakes the flat surface in depiction
and takes on complexity in theatrical decoration
or panoramic portrayal.</p>

<p>Architecture has its fundamental form, growth
from below upward, prescribed by static necessity;
window and roof necessarily provide the intermediate
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_3" title="3"> </a>and finishing configuration; these are
eternal and inviolable requirements of the art.</p>

<p>Poetry commands the abstract thought, which
it clothes in words. More independent than the
others, it reaches the furthest bounds.</p>

<p><i>But all arts, resources and forms ever aim at the
one end, namely, the imitation of nature and the
interpretation of human feelings.</i></p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<p>Architecture, sculpture, poetry and painting are
old and mature arts; their conceptions are established
and their objects assured; they have found
the way through uncounted centuries, and, like the
planets, describe their regular orbits.<a name="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>Music, compared with them, is a child that has
learned to walk, but must still be led. It is a
virgin art, without experience in life and suffering.</p>

<p>It is all unconscious as yet of what garb is
becoming, of its own advantages, its unawakened
capacities. And again, it is a child-marvel that is
already able to dispense much of beauty, that has
already brought joy to many, and whose gifts are
commonly held to have attained full maturity.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<p>Music as an art, our so-called occidental music,
is hardly four hundred years old; its state is one
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_4" title="4"> </a>of development, perhaps the very first stage of a
development beyond present conception, and we&mdash;we
talk of &ldquo;classics&rdquo; and &ldquo;hallowed traditions&rdquo;!
And we have talked of them for a long time!<a name="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>We have formulated rules, stated principles, laid
down laws;&mdash;we apply laws made for maturity to a
child that knows nothing of responsibility!</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<p>Young as it is, this child, we already recognize
that it possesses one radiant attribute which signalizes
it beyond all its elder sisters. And the lawgivers
will not see this marvelous attribute, lest
their laws should be thrown to the winds. This
child&mdash;it <em>floats on air</em>! It touches not the earth
with its feet. It knows no law of gravitation. It
is wellnigh incorporeal. Its material is transparent.
It is sonorous air. It is almost Nature herself.
It is&mdash;free.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<p>But freedom is something that mankind have
never wholly comprehended, never realized to the
full. They can neither recognize nor acknowledge
it.</p>

<p>They disavow the mission of this child; they
hang weights upon it. This buoyant creature must
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_5" title="5"> </a>walk decently, like anybody else. It may scarcely
be allowed to leap&mdash;when it were its joy to follow
the line of the rainbow, and to break sunbeams
with the clouds.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<div class="description">ABSOLUTE MUSIC</div>

<p>Music was born free; and to win freedom is its
destiny. It will become the most complete of all
reflexes of Nature by reason of its untrammeled
immateriality. Even the poetic word ranks lower
in point of incorporealness. It can gather together
and disperse, can be motionless repose or wildest
tempestuosity; it has the extremest heights perceptible
to man&mdash;what other art has these?&mdash;and
its emotion seizes the human heart with that
intensity which is independent of the &ldquo;idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It realizes a temperament, <em>without</em> describing it,
with the mobility of the soul, with the swiftness of
consecutive moments; and this, where painter or
sculptor can represent only one side or one moment,
and the poet tardily <em>communicates</em> a temperament
and its manifestations by words.</p>

<p>Therefore, representation and description are not
the nature of music; herewith we declare the
invalidity of program-music, and arrive at the
question: What are the aims of music?</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Absolute</span> Music! What the lawgivers mean
by this, is perhaps remotest of all from the
Absolute in music. &ldquo;Absolute music&rdquo; is a form-play
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_6" title="6"> </a>without poetic program, in which the form is
intended to have the leading part. But Form, in
itself, is the opposite pole of absolute music, on
which was bestowed the divine prerogative of
buoyancy, of freedom from the limitations of
matter. In a picture, the illustration of a sunset
ends with the frame; the limitless natural phenomenon
is enclosed in quadrilateral bounds; the
cloud-form chosen for depiction remains unchanging
for ever. Music can grow brighter or darker,
shift hither or yon, and finally fade away like the
sunset glow itself; and instinct leads the creative
musician to employ the tones that press the same
key within the human breast, and awaken the
same response, as the processes in Nature.</p>

<p>Per contra, &ldquo;absolute music&rdquo; is something very
sober, which reminds one of music-desks in orderly
rows, of the relation of Tonic to Dominant, of
Developments and Codas.</p>

<div class="description">THE FETISH OF FORM</div>

<p>Methinks I hear the second violin struggling, a
fourth below, to emulate the more dexterous first,
and contending in needless contest merely to arrive
at the starting-point. This sort of music ought
rather to be called the &ldquo;architectonic,&rdquo; or &ldquo;symmetric,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;sectional,&rdquo; and derives from the circumstance
that certain composers poured <em>their</em>
spirit and <em>their</em> emotion into just this mould
as lying nearest them or their time. Our lawgivers
have identified the spirit and emotion, the
individuality of these composers and their time,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_7" title="7"> </a>with &ldquo;symmetric&rdquo; music, and finally, being powerless
to recreate either the spirit, or the emotion,
or the time, have retained the Form as a symbol,
and made it into a fetish, a religion. The composers
sought and found this form as the aptest
vehicle for communicating <em>their</em> ideas; their souls
took flight&mdash;and the lawgivers discover and cherish
the garments Euphorion left behind on earth.</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 20em;">
<div class="stanza">
A lucky find! 'Twas now or never;<br/>
The flame is gone, it's true&mdash;however,<br/>
<span class="indent">No need to pity mankind now.<br/></span>
Enough is left for many a poet's tiring,<br/>
<span class="indent">Or to breed envy high and low;<br/></span>
And though I have no talents here for hiring,<br/>
<span class="indent">I'll hire the robe out, anyhow.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Is it not singular, to demand of a composer
originality in all things, and to forbid it as regards
form? No wonder that, once he becomes original,
he is accused of &ldquo;formlessness.&rdquo; Mozart! the
seeker and the finder, the great man with the
childlike heart&mdash;it is he we marvel at, to whom we
are devoted; but not his Tonic and Dominant, his
Developments and Codas.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<p>Such lust of liberation filled Beethoven, the
romantic revolutionary, that he ascended one short
step on the way leading music back to its loftier
self:&mdash;a short step in the great task, a wide step
in his own path. He did not quite reach absolute
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_8" title="8"> </a>music, but in certain moments he divined it, as in
the introduction to the fugue of the Sonata for
Hammerclavier. Indeed, all composers have drawn
nearest the true nature of music in preparatory
and intermediary passages (preludes and transitions),
where they felt at liberty to disregard
symmetrical proportions, and unconsciously drew
free breath. Even a Schumann (of so much lower
stature) is seized, in such passages, by some feeling
of the boundlessness of this pan-art (recall the
transition to the last movement of the D-minor
Symphony); and the same may be asserted of
Brahms in the introduction to the Finale of his
First Symphony.</p>

<p>But, the moment they cross the threshold of the
<em>Principal Subject</em>, their attitude becomes stiff and
conventional, like that of a man entering some
bureau of high officialdom.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<div class="description">BACH, BEETHOVEN, WAGNER</div>

<p>Next to Beethoven, Bach bears closest affinity
to &ldquo;infinite music.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> His Organ Fantasias (but
not the Fugues) have indubitably a strong dash of
what might be overwritten &ldquo;Man and Nature.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_D" href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>
In him it appears most ingenuous because he had
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_9" title="9"> </a>no reverence for his predecessors (although he
esteemed and made use of them), and because the
still novel acquisition of equal temperament opened
a vista of&mdash;for the time being&mdash;endless new possibilities.</p>

<p>Therefore, Bach and Beethoven<a name="FNanchor_E" href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> are to be
conceived as a <em>beginning</em>, and not as unsurpassable
finalities. In spirit and emotion they will probably
remain unexcelled; and this, again, confirms the
remark at the beginning of these lines: That
spirit and emotion remain unchanged in value
through changing years, and that he who mounts
to their uttermost heights will always tower above
the crowd.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<p>What still remains to be surpassed, is their form
of expression and their freedom. Wagner, a Germanic
Titan, who touched our earthly horizon in
orchestral tone-effect, who intensified the form of
expression, but fashioned it into a <em>system</em> (music-drama,
declamation, leading-motive), is on this
account incapable of further intensification. His
category begins and ends with himself; first,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_10" title="10"> </a>because he carried it to the highest perfection and
finish; secondly, because his self-imposed task was
of such a nature, that it could be achieved by one
man alone.<a name="FNanchor_F" href="#Footnote_F" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> The paths opened by Beethoven can
be followed to their end only through generations.
They&mdash;like all things in creation&mdash;may form only
a circle; but a circle of such dimensions, that the
portion visible to us seems like a straight line.
Wagner's circle we can view in its entirety&mdash;a circle
within the great circle.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<div class="description">PROGRAM AND MOTIVE</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span> name of Wagner leads to program-music.
This has been set up as a contrast to so-called
&ldquo;absolute&rdquo; music, and these concepts have become
so petrified that even persons of intelligence hold
one or the other dogma, without recognition for a
third possibility beyond and above the other two.
In reality, program-music is precisely as one-sided
and limited as that which is called absolute. In
place of architectonic and symmetric formulas,
instead of the relation of Tonic to Dominant, it
has bound itself in the stays of a connecting
poetic&mdash;sometimes even philosophic&mdash;program.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<p>Every motive&mdash;so it seems to me&mdash;contains, like
a seed, its life-germ within itself. From the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_11" title="11"> </a>different plant-seeds grow different families of
plants, dissimilar in form, foliage, blossom, fruit,
growth and color.<a name="FNanchor_G" href="#Footnote_G" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<p>Even each individual plant belonging to one and
the same species assumes, in size, form and strength,
a growth peculiar to itself. And so, in each motive,
there lies the embryo of its fully developed form;
each one must unfold itself differently, yet each
obediently follows the law of eternal harmony.
<em>This form is imperishable, though each be unlike
every other.</em></p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<p>The motive in a composition with program bears
within itself the same natural necessity; but it
must, even in its earliest phase of development,
renounce <em>its own proper mode of growth</em> to mould&mdash;or,
rather, twist&mdash;itself to fit the needs of the
program. Thus turned aside, at the outset, from
the path traced by nature, it finally arrives at a
wholly unexpected climax, whither it has been led,
not by its own organization, but by the way laid
down in the program, or the action, or the philosophical
idea.</p>

<p>And how primitive must this art remain! True,
there are unequivocal descriptive effects of tone-painting
(from these the entire principle took its
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_12" title="12"> </a>rise), but these means of expression are few and
trivial, covering but a very small section of musical
art. Begin with the most self-evident of all, the
debasement of Tone to Noise in imitating the
sounds of Nature&mdash;the rolling of thunder, the roar
of forests, the cries of animals; then those somewhat
less evident, symbolic&mdash;imitations of visual impressions,
like the lightning-flash, springing movement,
the flight of birds; again, those intelligible only
through the mediation of the reflective brain, such
as the trumpet-call as a warlike symbol, the shawm
to betoken ruralism, march-rhythm to signify
measured strides, the chorale as vehicle for religious
feeling. Add to the above the characterization of
nationalities&mdash;national instruments and airs&mdash;and
we have a complete inventory of the arsenal of
program-music. Movement and repose, minor and
major, high and low, in their customary significance,
round out the list.&mdash;These are auxiliaries,
of which good use can be made upon a broad
canvas, but which, taken by themselves, are no
more to be called music than wax figures may pass
for monuments.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<p>And, after all, what can the presentation of a
little happening upon this earth, the report concerning
an annoying neighbor&mdash;no matter whether
in the next room or in an adjoining quarter of the
globe&mdash;have in common with that music which
pervades the universe?</p>

<div class="description">WHAT MUSIC EXPRESSES</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_13" title="13"> </a>
To music, indeed, it is given to set in vibration
our human moods: Dread (<i>Leporello</i>), oppression
of soul, invigoration, lassitude (Beethoven's last
Quartets), decision (<i>Wotan</i>), hesitation, despondency,
encouragement, harshness, tenderness, excitement,
tranquillization, the feeling of surprise or
expectancy, and still others; likewise the inner echo
of external occurrences which is bound up in these
moods of the soul. But not the moving cause
itself of these spiritual affections;&mdash;not the joy over
an avoided danger, not the danger itself, or the
kind of danger which caused the dread; an emotional
state, yes, but not the psychic species of
this emotion, such as envy, or jealousy; and it is
equally futile to attempt the expression, through
music, of moral characteristics (vanity, cleverness),
or abstract ideas like truth and justice. Is
it possible to imagine how a poor, but contented
man could be represented by music? The contentment,
the soul-state, can be interpreted by
music; but where does the poverty appear, or the
important ethic problem stated in the words &ldquo;poor,
but contented&rdquo;? This is due to the fact that
&ldquo;poor&rdquo; connotes a phase of terrestrial and social
conditions not to be found in the eternal harmony.
And Music is a part of the vibrating universe.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<p>I may be allowed to subjoin a few subsidiary
reflections:&mdash;The greater part of modern theatre
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_14" title="14"> </a>music suffers from the mistake of seeking to repeat
the scenes passing on the stage, instead of fulfilling
its own proper mission of interpreting the
soul-states of the persons represented. When the
scene presents the illusion of a thunderstorm, this
is exhaustively apprehended by the eye. Nevertheless,
nearly all composers strive to depict the
storm in tones&mdash;which is not only a needless and
feebler repetition, but likewise a failure to perform
their true function. The person on the stage is
either psychically influenced by the thunderstorm,
or his mood, being absorbed in a train of thought
of stronger influence, remains unaffected. The
storm is visible and audible without aid from
music; it is the invisible and inaudible, the spiritual
processes of the personages portrayed, which music
should render intelligible.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<p>Again, there are &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; psychic conditions
on the stage, whereof music need take no account.
Suppose a theatrical situation in which a convivial
company is passing at night and disappears from
view, while in the foreground a silent, envenomed
duel is in progress. Here the music, by means of
continuing song, should keep in mind the jovial
company now lost to sight; the acts and feelings
of the pair in the foreground may be understood
without further commentary, and the music&mdash;dramatically
speaking&mdash;ought not to participate in
their action and break the tragic silence.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_15" title="15"> </a>
Measurably justified, in my opinion, is the plan
of the old opera, which concentrated and musically
rounded out the passions aroused by a moving
dramatic scene in a piece of set form (the aria).
<em>Word</em> and stage-play conveyed the dramatic progress
of the action, followed more or less meagrely
by musical recitative; arrived at the point of rest,
music resumed the reins. This is less extrinsic than
some would now have us believe. On the other
hand, it was the ossified form of the &ldquo;aria&rdquo; itself
which led to inveracity of expression and decadence.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<div class="description">NOTATION <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">VERSUS</i> EMOTION</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span> audible presentation, the &ldquo;performance,&rdquo;
of music, its <em>emotional interpretation</em>, derives
from those free heights whence descended the Art
itself. Where the art is threatened by earthliness,
it is the part of interpretation to raise it and
re√´ndow it with its primordial essence.</p>

<p>Notation, the writing out of compositions, is
primarily an ingenious expedient for catching an
inspiration, with the purpose of exploiting it later.
But notation is to improvisation as the portrait
to the living model. It is for the interpreter to
<em>resolve the rigidity of the signs</em> into the primitive
emotion.</p>

<p>But the lawgivers require the interpreter to
reproduce the rigidity of the signs; they consider
his reproduction the nearer to perfection, the more
closely it clings to the signs.<a class="pagenum" name="Page_16" title="16"> </a>&mdash;</p>

<p>What the composer's inspiration <em>necessarily</em>
loses<a name="FNanchor_H" href="#Footnote_H" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> through notation, his interpreter should
restore by his own.</p>

<p>To the lawgivers, the signs themselves are the
most important matter, and are continually growing
in their estimation; the new art of music is
derived from the old signs&mdash;<em>and these now stand for
musical art itself</em>.</p>

<p>If the lawgivers had their way, any given composition
would always be reproduced in precisely
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_17" title="17"> </a>the same tempo, whensoever, by whomsoever, and
under whatsoever conditions it might be performed.</p>

<p>But, it <em>is</em> not possible; the buoyant, expansive
nature of the divine child rebels&mdash;it demands the
opposite. Each day begins differently from the
preceding, yet always with the flush of dawn.&mdash;Great
artists play their own works differently at
each repetition, remodel them on the spur of the
moment, accelerate and retard, in a way which
they could not indicate by signs&mdash;and always
according to the given conditions of that &ldquo;eternal
harmony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then the lawgiver chafes, and refers the
creator to his own handwriting. As matters stand
to-day, the lawgiver has the best of the argument.</p>

<div class="description">NOTATION AND TRANSCRIPTION</div>

<p>&ldquo;Notation&rdquo; (&ldquo;writing down&rdquo;) brings up the
subject of Transcription, nowadays a term much
misunderstood, almost discreditable. The frequent
antagonism which I have excited with &ldquo;transcriptions,&rdquo;
and the opposition to which an ofttimes
irrational criticism has provoked me, caused me to
seek a clear understanding of this point. My final
conclusion concerning it is this: Every notation
is, in itself, the transcription of an abstract idea.
The instant the pen seizes it, the idea loses its
original form. The very intention to write down
the idea, compels a choice of measure and key.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_18" title="18"> </a>The form, and the musical agency, which the composer
must decide upon, still more closely define
the way and the limits.</p>

<p>It is much the same as with man himself. Born
naked, and as yet without definite aspirations, he
decides, or at a given moment is made to decide,
upon a career. From the moment of decision,
although much that is original and imperishable
in the idea or the man may live on, either is
depressed to the type of a class. The musical idea
becomes a sonata or a concerto; the man, a soldier
or a priest. That is an Arrangement of the original.
From this first transcription to a second the step
is comparatively short and unimportant. And yet
it is only the second, in general, of which any
notice is taken; overlooking the fact, that a transcription
does not destroy the archetype, which is,
therefore, not lost through transcription.</p>

<p>Again, the performance of a work is also a transcription,
and still, whatever liberties it may take,
it can never annihilate the original.</p>

<p>For the musical art-work exists, before its tones
resound and after they die away, <em>complete and
intact</em>. It exists both within and outside of time,
and through its nature we can obtain a definite
conception of the otherwise intangible notion of the
Ideality of Time.</p>

<p>For the rest, most of Beethoven's piano compositions
sound like transcriptions of orchestral
works; most of Schumann's orchestral compositions,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_19" title="19"> </a>like arrangements from pieces for the piano&mdash;and
they are so, in a way.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the Variation-Form is highly
esteemed by the Worshippers of the Letter. That
is singular; for the variation-form&mdash;when built up
on a borrowed theme&mdash;produces a <em>whole series of
&ldquo;arrangements&rdquo;</em> which, besides, are least respectful
when most ingenious.</p>

<p>So the arrangement is <em>not</em> good, because it <em>varies</em>
the original; and the variation <em>is</em> good, although it
&ldquo;<em>arranges</em>&rdquo; the original.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<div class="description">WHAT IS MUSICAL?</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span> term &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">musikalisch</span>&rdquo; (musical) is used by
the Germans in a sense foreign to that in
which any other language employs it.<a name="FNanchor_I" href="#Footnote_I" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> It is a
conception belonging to the Germans, and not to
culture in general; the expression is incorrect and
untranslatable. &ldquo;Musical&rdquo; is derived from <em>music</em>,
like &ldquo;poetical&rdquo; from <em>poetry</em>, or &ldquo;physical&rdquo; from
<em>physic(s)</em>. When I say, &ldquo;Schubert was one of the
most musical among men,&rdquo; it is the same as if I
should say, &ldquo;Helmholtz was one of the most
physical among men.&rdquo; That is musical, which
<em>sounds</em> in rhythms and intervals. A cupboard can
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_20" title="20"> </a>be &ldquo;musical,&rdquo; if &ldquo;music-works&rdquo; be enclosed in it.<a name="FNanchor_J" href="#Footnote_J" class="fnanchor">[J]</a>
In a comparative sense, &ldquo;musical&rdquo; may have the
further signification of &ldquo;euphonious.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;My verses
are too musical to bear setting to music,&rdquo; a noted
poet once remarked to me.</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 13em;">
<div class="stanza">
&ldquo;Spirits moving musically<br/>
<span class="quote">To a lute's well-tuned law,&rdquo;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">writes Edgar Allan Poe. Lastly, one may speak
quite correctly of &ldquo;musical laughter,&rdquo; because it
<em>sounds</em> like music.</p>

<p>Taking the signification in which the term is
applied and almost exclusively employed in
German, a musical person is one who manifests an
inclination for music by a nice discrimination and
sensitiveness with regard to the <em>technical aspects</em>
of the art. By &ldquo;technics&rdquo; I mean rhythm,
harmony, intonation, part-leading, and the treatment
of themes. The more subtleties he is capable
of hearing or reproducing in these, the more
&ldquo;musical&rdquo; he is held to be.</p>

<p>In view of the great importance attached to
these elements of the art, this &ldquo;musical&rdquo; temperament
has naturally become of the highest consequence.
And so an artist who plays with perfect
technical finish should be deemed the most musical
player. But as we mean by &ldquo;technics&rdquo; only the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_21" title="21"> </a>mechanical mastery of the instrument, the terms
&ldquo;technical&rdquo; and &ldquo;musical&rdquo; have been turned into
opposites.</p>

<p>The matter has been carried so far as to call a
composition itself &ldquo;musical,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_K" href="#Footnote_K" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> or even to assert of
a great composer like Berlioz that he was not
sufficiently musical.<a name="FNanchor_L" href="#Footnote_L" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> &ldquo;Unmusical&rdquo; conveys the
strongest reproach; branded thus, its object
becomes an outlaw.<a name="FNanchor_M" href="#Footnote_M" class="fnanchor">[M]</a></p>

<p>In a country like Italy, where all participate in
the delights of music, this differentiation becomes
superfluous, and the term corresponding is not
found in the language. In France, where a living
sense of music does not permeate the people, there
are musicians and non-musicians; of the rest, some
&ldquo;are very fond of music,&rdquo; and others &ldquo;do not care
for it.&rdquo; Only in Germany is it made a point of
honor to be &ldquo;musical,&rdquo; that is to say, not merely
to love music, but more especially to understand
it as regards its technical means of expression, and
to obey their rules.</p>

<p>A thousand hands support the buoyant child
and solicitously attend its footsteps, that it may
not soar aloft where there might be risk of a serious
fall. But it is still so young, and is eternal; the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_22" title="22"> </a>day of its freedom will come.&mdash;When it shall cease
to be &ldquo;musical.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span> creator should take over no traditional
law in blind belief, which would make him
view his own creative endeavor, from the outset,
as an exception contrasting with that law. For
his individual case he should seek out and formulate
a fitting individual law, which, after the first complete
realization, he should annul, that he himself
may not be drawn into repetitions when his next
work shall be in the making.</p>

<p>The function of the creative artist consists in
making laws, not in following laws ready made.
He who follows such laws, ceases to be a creator.</p>

<p>Creative power may be the more readily recognized,
the more it shakes itself loose from tradition.
But an intentional avoidance of the rules cannot
masquerade as creative power, and still less
engender it.</p>

<p>The true creator strives, in reality, after <em>perfection</em>
only. And through bringing this into harmony
with <em>his own</em> individuality, a new law arises without
premeditation.</p>

<p>So narrow has our tonal range become, so
stereotyped its form of expression, that nowadays
there is not one familiar motive that cannot be
fitted with some other familiar motive so that the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_23" title="23"> </a>two may be played simultaneously. Not to lose
my way in trifling,<a name="FNanchor_N" href="#Footnote_N" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> I shall refrain from giving
examples.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<p>That which, within our present-day music, most
nearly approaches the essential nature of the art,
is the Rest and the Hold (Pause). Consummate
players, improvisers, know how to employ these
instruments of expression in loftier and ampler
measure. The tense silence between two movements&mdash;<em>in
itself music</em>, in this environment&mdash;leaves
wider scope for divination than the more determinate,
but therefore less elastic, sound.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<div class="description">MUSIC, AND SIGNS FOR MUSIC</div>

<p>What we now call our Tonal System is nothing
more than a set of &ldquo;signs&rdquo;; an ingenious device to
grasp somewhat of that eternal harmony; a meagre
pocket-edition of that encyclopedic work; artificial
light instead of the sun.&mdash;Have you ever noticed
how people gaze open-mouthed at the brilliant
illumination of a hall? They never do so at the
millionfold brighter sunshine of noonday.&mdash;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_24" title="24"> </a>
And so, in music, the signs have assumed greater
consequence than that which they ought to stand
for, and can only suggest.</p>

<p>How important, indeed, are &ldquo;Third,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fifth,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Octave&rdquo;! How strictly we divide &ldquo;consonances&rdquo;
from &ldquo;dissonances&rdquo;&mdash;<em>in a sphere where no
dissonances can possibly exist</em>!</p>

<p>We have divided the octave into twelve equidistant
degrees, because we had to manage somehow,
and have constructed our instruments in
such a way that we can never get in above or
below or between them. Keyboard instruments,
in particular, have so thoroughly schooled our ears
that we are no longer capable of hearing anything
else&mdash;incapable of hearing except through this
impure medium. Yet Nature created an <em>infinite
gradation</em>&mdash;<em>infinite!</em> who still knows it nowadays?<a name="FNanchor_O" href="#Footnote_O" class="fnanchor">[O]</a></p>

<div class="description">THE CONTRACTED SYSTEM OF MUSIC</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_25" title="25"> </a>
And within this duodecimal octave we have
marked out a series of fixed intervals, seven in
number, and founded thereon our entire art of
music. What do I say&mdash;<em>one</em> series? Two such
series, one for each leg: The Major and Minor
Scales. When we start this series of intervals on
some other degree of our semitonic ladder, we
obtain a <em>new key</em>, and a &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; one, at that!
How violently contracted a system arose from this
initial confusion,<a name="FNanchor_P" href="#Footnote_P" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> may be read in the law-books;
we will not repeat it here.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<p>We teach four-and-twenty keys, twelve times
the two Series of Seven; but, in point of fact, we
have at our command only two, the major key
and the minor key. <em>The rest are merely transpositions.</em>
By means of the several transpositions
we are supposed to get different shades of harmony;
but this is an illusion. In England, under the reign
of the high &ldquo;concert pitch,&rdquo; the most familiar
works may be played a semitone higher than they
are written, without changing their effect. Singers
transpose an aria to suit their convenience, leaving
untransposed what precedes and follows. Song-writers
not infrequently publish their own compositions
in three different pitches; in all three
editions the pieces are precisely alike.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_26" title="26"> </a>
When a well-known face looks out of a window,
it matters not whether it gazes down from the
first story or the third.</p>

<p>Were it feasible to elevate or depress a landscape,
far as eye can reach, by several hundred yards, the
pictorial impression would neither gain nor lose
by it.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<div class="description">MAJOR AND MINOR</div>

<p>Upon the two Series of Seven, the major key
and the minor key, the whole art of music has been
established; one limitation brings on the other.</p>

<p>To each of these a definite character has been
attributed; we have learned and have taught that
they should be heard as contrasts, and they have
gradually acquired the significance of symbols:&mdash;Major
and Minor&mdash;<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Maggiore e Minore</span>&mdash;Contentment
and Discontent&mdash;Joy and Sorrow&mdash;Light and
Shade. The harmonic symbols have fenced in the
expression of music, from Bach to Wagner, and
yet further on until to-day and the day after
to-morrow. <em>Minor</em> is employed with the same
intention, and has the same effect upon us now,
as two hundred years ago. Nowadays it is no
longer possible to &ldquo;compose&rdquo; a funeral march, for
it already exists, once for all. Even the least
informed non-professional knows what to expect
when a funeral march&mdash;whichever you please&mdash;is
to be played. Even such an one can anticipate the
difference between a symphony in major and one
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_27" title="27"> </a>in minor. We are tyrannized by Major and
Minor&mdash;by the bifurcated garment.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<p>Strange, that one should feel major and minor
as opposites. They both present the same face,
now more joyous, now more serious; and a mere
touch of the brush suffices to turn the one into the
other. The passage from either to the other is
easy and imperceptible; when it occurs frequently
and swiftly, the two begin to shimmer and coalesce
indistinguishably.&mdash;But when we recognize that
major and minor form one Whole with a double
meaning, and that the &ldquo;four-and-twenty keys&rdquo;
are simply an elevenfold transposition of the
original twain, we arrive unconstrainedly at a
perception of the <small>UNITY</small> <em>of our system of keys</em>
[tonality]. The conceptions of &ldquo;related&rdquo; and
&ldquo;foreign&rdquo; keys vanish, and with them the entire
intricate theory of degrees and relations. <em>We
possess one single key.</em> But it is of most meagre
sort.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unity of the key-system.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;&ldquo;I suppose you mean that &lsquo;key&rsquo; and &lsquo;key-system&rsquo;
are the sunbeam and its diffraction into
colors?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No; that I can not mean. For our whole system
of tone, key, and tonality, taken in its entirety,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_28" title="28"> </a>is only a part of a fraction of one diffracted ray
from that Sun, &ldquo;Music,&rdquo; in the empyrean of the
&ldquo;eternal harmony.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<div class="description">NATURE, AND THE REFORMER</div>

<p>However deeply rooted the attachment to the
habitual, and inertia, may be in the ways and
nature of humankind, in equal measure are energy,
and opposition to the existing order, characteristic
of all that has life. Nature has her wiles, and
persuades man, obstinately opposed though he be
to progress and change; Nature progresses continually
and changes unremittingly, but with so
even and unnoticeable movement that men perceive
only quiescence. Only on looking backward
from a distance do they note with astonishment
that they have been deceived.</p>

<p>The Reformer of any given period excites irritation
for the reason that his changes find men
unprepared, and, above all, because these changes
are appreciable. The Reformer, in comparison
with Nature, is undiplomatic; and, as a wholly
logical consequence, his changes do not win general
acceptance until Time, with subtle, imperceptible
advance, has bridged over the leap of the self-assured
leader. Yet we find cases in which the
reformer marched abreast of the times, while the
rest fell behind. And then they have to be forced
and lashed to take the leap across the passage
they have missed. I believe that the major-and-minor
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_29" title="29"> </a>key with its transpositional relations, our
&ldquo;twelve-semitone system,&rdquo; exhibits such a case of
falling behind.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<p>That some few have already felt how the intervals
of the Series of Seven might be differently arranged
(graduated) is manifested in isolated passages by
Liszt, and recently by Debussy and his following,
and even by Richard Strauss. Strong impulse,
longing, gifted instinct, all speak from these
strains. Yet it does not appear to me that a
conscious and orderly conception of this intensified
means of expression had been formed by these
composers.</p>

<p>I have made an attempt to exhaust the possibilities
of the arrangement of degrees within the
seven-tone scale; and succeeded, by raising and
lowering the intervals, in establishing <em>one hundred
and thirteen different scales</em>. These 113 scales
(within the octave <i>C&ndash;C</i>) comprise the greater part
of our familiar twenty-four keys, and, furthermore,
a series of new keys of peculiar character. But
with these the mine is not exhausted, for we are
at liberty to <em>transpose</em> each one of these 113,
besides the blending of two such keys in harmony
and melody.</p>

<p>There is a significant difference between the sound
of the scale <i>c</i>-<i>d</i>&#9837;-<i>e</i>&#9837;-<i>f</i>&#9837;-<i>g</i>&#9837;-<i>a</i>&#9837;-<i>b</i>&#9837;-<i>c</i> when <i>c</i> is taken as
tonic, and the scale of <i>d</i>&#9837; minor. By giving it the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_30" title="30"> </a>customary <i>C</i>-major triad as a fundamental harmony,
a novel harmonic sensation is obtained.
But now listen to this same scale supported
alternately by the <i>A</i>-minor, <i>E</i>&#9837;-major, and <i>C</i>-major
triads, and you cannot avoid a feeling of delightful
surprise at the strangely unfamiliar euphony.</p>

<p>But how would a lawgiver classify the tone-series
<i>c</i>-<i>d</i>&#9837;-<i>e</i>&#9837;-<i>f</i>&#9837;-<i>g</i>-<i>a</i>-<i>b</i>-<i>c</i>, <i>c</i>-<i>d</i>&#9837;-<i>e</i>&#9837;-<i>f</i>-<i>g</i>&#9837;-<i>a</i>-<i>b</i>-<i>c</i>,
<i>c</i>-<i>d</i>-<i>e</i>&#9837;-<i>f</i>&#9837;-<i>g</i>&#9837;-<i>a</i>-<i>b</i>-<i>c</i>,
<i>c</i>-<i>d</i>&#9837;-<i>e</i>-<i>f</i>-<i>g</i>&#9837;-<i>a</i>-<i>b</i>&#9837;-<i>c</i>?&mdash;or these, forsooth:
<i>c</i>-<i>d</i>-<i>e</i>&#9837;-<i>f</i>&#9837;-<i>g</i>-<i>a</i>&#9839;-<i>b</i>-<i>c</i>,
<i>c</i>-<i>d</i>-<i>e</i>&#9837;-<i>f</i>&#9837;-<i>g</i>&#9839;-<i>a</i>-<i>b</i>-<i>c</i>, <i>c</i>-<i>d</i>&#9837;-<i>e</i>&#9837;-<i>f</i>&#9839;-<i>g</i>&#9839;-<i>a</i>-<i>b</i>&#9837;-<i>c</i>?</p>

<p>One cannot estimate at a glance what wealth of
melodic and harmonic expression would thus be
opened up to the hearing; but a great many novel
possibilities may be accepted as certain, and are
perceptible at a glance.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<p>With this presentation, the unity of all keys may
be considered as finally pronounced and justified. A
kaleidoscopic blending and interchanging of twelve
semitones within the three-mirror tube of Taste,
Emotion, and Intention&mdash;the essential feature of
the harmony of to-day.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<div class="description">INFINITE HARMONY</div>

<p>The harmony of <em>to-day</em>, and not for long; for all
signs presage a revolution, and a next step toward
that &ldquo;eternal harmony.&rdquo; Let us once again call
to mind, that in this latter the gradation of the
octave is <em>infinite</em>, and let us strive to draw a little
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_31" title="31"> </a>nearer to infinitude. The tripartite tone (third of
a tone) has for some time been demanding admittance,
and we have left the call unheeded. Whoever
has experimented, like myself (in a modest
way), with this interval, and introduced (either
with voice or with violin) two equidistant intermediate
tones between the extremes of a whole
tone, schooling his ear and his precision of attack,
will not have failed to discern that tripartite tones
are wholly independent intervals with a pronounced
character, and not to be confounded with ill-tuned
semitones. They form a refinement in chromatics
based, as at present appears, on the whole-tone
scale. Were we to adopt them without further
preparation, we should have to give up the semitones
and lose our &ldquo;minor third&rdquo; and &ldquo;perfect
fifth;&rdquo; and this loss would be felt more keenly than
the relative gain of a system of eighteen one-third
tones.</p>

<p>But there is no apparent reason for giving up
the semitones for the sake of this new system. By
retaining, for each whole tone, a semitone, we
obtain a second series of whole tones lying a
semitone higher than the original series. Then, by
dividing this second series of whole tones into
third-tones, each third-tone in the lower series will
be matched by a semitone in the higher series.</p>

<div class="description">THE TRIPARTITE TONE</div>

<p>Thus we have really arrived at a system of
whole tones divided into sixths of a tone; and we
may be sure that even sixth-tones will sometime
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_32" title="32"> </a>be adopted into musical speech. But the tonal
system above sketched must first of all train the
hearing to thirds of a tone, without giving up the
semitones.</p>

<p>To summarize: We may set up either two
series of third-tones, with an interval of a semitone
between the series; or, the usual semitonic series
<em>thrice repeated</em> at the interval of one-third of a tone.</p>

<p>Merely for the sake of distinction, let us call
the first tone <i>C</i>, and the next third-tones <i>C</i>&#9839;, and
<i>D</i>&#9837;; the first semitone (small) <i>c</i>, and its following
thirds <i>c</i>&#9839; and <i>d</i>&#9837;; the result is fully explained by
the table below:</p>

</div>

<p>A preliminary expedient for notation might be,
to draw six lines for the staff, using the lines for
the whole tones and the spaces for the semitones:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/music2.png" width="600" height="65" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p class="no-indent">then indicating the third-tones by sharps and flats:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/music3.png" width="600" height="81" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_33" title="33"> </a>
The question of notation seems to me subordinate.
On the other hand, the question is
important and imperious, how and on what these
tones are to be produced. Fortunately, while
busied with this essay, I received from America
direct and authentic intelligence which solves the
problem in a simple manner. I refer to an invention
by Dr. Thaddeus Cahill.<a name="FNanchor_Q" href="#Footnote_Q" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> He has constructed
a comprehensive apparatus which makes it possible
to transform an electric current into a fixed and
mathematically exact number of vibrations. As
pitch depends on the number of vibrations, and
the apparatus may be &ldquo;set&rdquo; on any number
desired, the infinite gradation of the octave may
be accomplished by merely moving a lever corresponding
to the pointer of a quadrant.</p>

<p>Only a long and careful series of experiments,
and a continued training of the ear, can render
this unfamiliar material approachable and plastic
for the coming generation, and for Art.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<p>And what a vista of fair hopes and dreamlike
fancies is thus opened for them both! Who has
not dreamt that he could float on air? and firmly
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_34" title="34"> </a>believed his dream to be reality?&mdash;Let us take
thought, how music may be restored to its primitive,
natural essence; let us free it from architectonic,
acoustic and esthetic dogmas; let it be pure
invention and sentiment, in harmonies, in forms,
in tone-colors (for invention and sentiment are
not the prerogative of melody alone); let it follow
the line of the rainbow and vie with the clouds
in breaking sunbeams; <em>let Music be naught else than
Nature mirrored by and reflected from the human
breast</em>; for it is sounding air and floats above
and beyond the air; within Man himself as universally
and absolutely as in Creation entire; for it
can gather together and disperse without losing in
intensity.</p>

<div class="description">NIETZSCHE AND GERMAN MUSIC</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">In</span> his book &ldquo;Beyond the Good and the Bad&rdquo;
(<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jenseits von Gut und B√∂se</cite>) Nietzsche says:
&ldquo;With regard to German music I consider precaution
necessary in various ways. Assuming that
a person loves the South (as I love it) as a great
training-school for health of soul and sense in
their highest potency, as an uncontrollable flood
and glamour of sunshine spreading over a race of
independent and self-reliant beings;&mdash;well, such an
one will learn to be more or less on his guard
against German music, because, while spoiling his
taste anew, it undermines his health.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such a Southlander (not by descent, but by
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_35" title="35"> </a>belief) must, should he dream of the future of
music, likewise dream of a redemption of music
from the North, while in his ears there rings the
prelude to a deeper, mightier, perchance a more
evil and more mysterious music, a super-German
music, which does not fade, wither and die away
in view of the blue, sensuous sea and the splendor
of Mediterranean skies, as all German music does;&mdash;a
super-European music, that asserts itself even
amid the tawny sunsets of the desert, whose soul
is allied with the palm-tree, and can consort and
prowl with great, beautiful, lonely beasts of prey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could imagine a music whose rarest charm
should consist in its complete divorce from the
Good and the Bad;&mdash;only that its surface might
be ruffled, as it were, by a longing as of a sailor
for home, by variable golden shadows and tender
frailties:&mdash;an Art which should see fleeing toward
it, from afar off, the hues of a perishing moral
world become wellnigh incomprehensible, and
which should be hospitable and profound enough
to harbor such belated fugitives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Tolstoi transmutes a landscape-impression
into a musical impression when he writes, in
&ldquo;Lucerne&rdquo;: <a class="pagenum" name="Page_36" title="36"> </a>&ldquo;Neither on the lake, nor on the
mountains, nor in the skies, a single straight line,
a single unmixed color, a single point of repose;&mdash;everywhere
movement, irregularity, caprice, variety,
an incessant interplay of shades and lines,
and in it all the reposefulness, softness, harmony
and inevitableness of Beauty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will this music ever be attained?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not all reach Nirvana; but he who, gifted from
the beginning, learns everything that one ought
to learn, experiences all that one should experience,
renounces what one should renounce, develops
what one should develop, realizes what one
should realize&mdash;he shall reach Nirvana.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_R" href="#Footnote_R" class="fnanchor">[R]</a> (<span class="smcap">Kern</span>,
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Geschichte des Buddhismus in Indien</cite>.)</p>

<p>If Nirvana be the realm &ldquo;beyond the Good and
the Bad,&rdquo; <em>one</em> way leading thither is here pointed
out. A way to the very portal. To the bars that
divide Man from Eternity&mdash;or that open to admit
that which was temporal. Beyond that portal
sounds <em>music</em>. Not the strains of &ldquo;musical art.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_S" href="#Footnote_S" class="fnanchor">[S]</a>&mdash;It
may be, that we must leave Earth to find that
music. But only to the pilgrim who has succeeded
on the way in freeing himself from earthly shackles,
shall the bars open.</p>

<h2>ADDENDA</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Feeling</span>&mdash;like honesty&mdash;is a moral point of
honor, an attribute of whose possession no
one will permit denial, which claims a place in life
and art alike. But while, in life, a want of feeling
may be forgiven to the possessor of a more brilliant
attribute, such as bravery or impartial justice, in
art feeling is held to be the highest moral qualification.</p>

<p>In music, however, feeling requires two consorts,
taste and style. Now, in life, one encounters real
taste as seldom as deep and true feeling; as for
style, it is a province of art. What remains, is a
species of pseudo-emotion which must be characterized
as lachrymose hysteria or turgidity. And,
above all, people insist upon having it plainly
paraded before their eyes! It must be underscored,
so that everybody shall stop, look, and listen.
The audience sees it, greatly magnified, thrown on
the screen, so that it dances before the vision in
vague, importunate vastness; it is cried on the
streets, to summon them that dwell remote from
art; it is gilded, to make the destitute stare in
amaze.</p>

<p>For in life, too, the <em>expressions</em> of feeling, by
mien and words, are oftenest employed; rarer,
and more genuine, is that feeling which acts
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_38" title="38"> </a>without talk; and most precious is the feeling which
hides itself.</p>

<div class="description">FEELING</div>

<p>&ldquo;Feeling&rdquo; is generally understood to mean
tenderness, pathos, and extravagance, of expression.
But how much more does the marvelous flower
&ldquo;Emotion&rdquo; enfold! Restraint and forbearance,
renunciation, power, activity, patience, magnanimity,
joyousness, and that all-controlling intelligence
wherein feeling actually takes its rise.</p>

<p>It is not otherwise in Art, which holds the mirror
up to Life; and still more outspokenly in Music,
which repeats the emotions of Life&mdash;though for
this, as I have said, taste and style must be added;
Style, which distinguishes Art from Life.</p>

<p>What the amateur and the mediocre artist
attempt to express, is feeling in little, in detail,
for a short stretch.</p>

<p>Feeling on a grand scale is mistaken by the
amateur, the semi-artist, the public (and the
critics too, unhappily!), for a want of emotion,
because they all are unable to hear the longer
reaches as parts of a yet more extended whole.
Feeling, therefore, is likewise economy.</p>

<p>Hence, I distinguish feeling as Taste, as Style,
as Economy. Each a whole in itself, and each
one-third of the Whole. Within and over them
rules a subjective trinity: Temperament, Intelligence,
and the instinct of Equipoise.</p>

<p>These six carry on a dance of such subtility in
the choice of partners and intertwining of figures,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_39" title="39"> </a>in the bearing and the being borne, in advancing
and curtesying, in motion and repose, that no
loftier height of artistry is conceivable.</p>

<p>When the chords of the two triads are in perfect
tune, Fantasy may&mdash;nay, must&mdash;associate with
Feeling; supported by the Six, she will not degenerate,
and out of this combination of all the elements
arises Individuality. The individuality catches,
like a lens, the light-impressions, reflects them,
according to its nature, as a negative, and the
hearer perceives the true picture.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<p>In so far as taste participates in feeling, the
latter&mdash;like all else&mdash;alters its forms of expression
with the period. That is, one aspect or another
of feeling will be favored at one time or another,
onesidedly cultivated, especially developed. Thus,
with and after Wagner, voluptuous sensuality came
to the fore; the form of <em>intensification of passion</em>
is still unsurmounted by contemporary composers.
On every tranquil beginning followed a swift
upward surge. Wagner, in this point insatiable,
but not inexhaustible, turned from sheer necessity
to the expedient, after reaching a climax, of starting
afresh softly, to soar to a sudden new intensification.</p>

<p>Modern French writers exhibit a revulsion; their
feeling is a reflexive chastity, or perhaps rather a
restrained sensualism; the upstriving mountain-paths
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_40" title="40"> </a>of Wagner are succeeded by monotonous
plains of twilight uniformity.</p>

<p>Thus &ldquo;style&rdquo; forms itself out of feeling, when
led by taste.</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Apostles of the Ninth Symphony&rdquo; have
devised the notion of &ldquo;depth&rdquo; in music. It is
still current at face-value, especially in Germanic
lands.</p>

<p>There is a depth of feeling, and a depth of
thought; the latter is literary, and can have no
application to tones. Depth of feeling, by contrast,
is psychical, and thoroughly germane to the nature
of music. The Apostles of the Ninth Symphony
have a peculiar and not quite clearly defined
estimate of &ldquo;depth&rdquo; in music. <em>Depth</em> becomes
<em>breadth</em>, and the attempt is made to attain it
through <em>weight</em>; it then discovers itself (through an
association of ideas) by a preference for a <em>deep
register</em>, and (as I have had opportunity to observe)
by the insinuation of a second, mysterious notion,
usually of a literary sort. If these are not the
sole specific signs, they are the most important
ones.</p>

<p>To every disciple of philosophy, however, depth
of feeling would seem to imply exhaustiveness in
feeling, a complete absorption in the given mood.</p>

<p>Whoever, surrounded by the full tide of a
genuine carnival crowd, slinks about morosely or
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_41" title="41"> </a>even indifferently, neither affected nor carried away
by the tremendous self-satire of mask and motley,
by the might of misrule over law, by the vengeful
feeling of wit running riot, shows himself incapable
of sounding the depths of feeling. This gives
further confirmation of the fact, that depth of
feeling roots in a complete absorption in the
given mood, however frivolous, and blossoms in
the interpretation of that mood; whereas the current
conception of deep feeling singles out only
one aspect of feeling in man, and specializes that.</p>

<p>In the so-called &ldquo;Champagne Aria&rdquo; in Don
Giovanni there lies more &ldquo;depth&rdquo; than in many a
funeral march or nocturne:&mdash;Depth of feeling also
shows in not wasting it on subordinate or unimportant
matters.</p>

<hr/>

<div class="description">ROUTINE</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Routine</span> is highly esteemed and frequently
required; in musical &ldquo;officialdom&rdquo; it is a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua non</i>. That routine in music should exist
at all, and, furthermore, that it can be nominated
as a condition in the musician's bond, is another
proof of the narrow confines of our musical art.
Routine signifies the acquisition of a modicum of
experience and artcraft, and their application to
all cases which may occur; hence, there must be
an astounding number of analogous cases. Now,
I like to imagine a species of art-praxis wherein
each case should be a new one, an exception! How
helpless and impotent would the army of practical
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_42" title="42"> </a>musicians stand before it!&mdash;in the end they would
surely beat a retreat, and disappear. Routine
transforms the temple of art into a factory. It
destroys creativeness. For creation means, the
bringing form out of the void; whereas routine
flourishes on imitation. It is &ldquo;poetry made to
order.&rdquo; It rules because it suits the generality:
In the theatre, in the orchestra, in virtuosi, in
instruction. One longs to exclaim, &ldquo;Avoid routine!
Let each beginning be, as had none been before!
Know nothing, but rather think and feel! For,
behold, the myriad strains that once shall sound
have existed since the beginning, ready, afloat in
the √¶ther, and together with them other myriads
that shall never be heard. Only stretch forth your
hands, and ye shall grasp a blossom, a breath of
the sea-breeze, a sunbeam; avoid routine, for it
strives to grasp only that wherewith your four
walls are filled, and the same over and over again;
the spirit of ease so infects you, that you will
scarcely leave your armchairs, and will lay hold
only of what is nearest to hand. And myriad
strains are there since the beginning, still waiting
for manifestation!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="asterisk-break">*<br/>**</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my misfortune, to possess no routine,&rdquo;
Wagner once wrote Liszt, when the composition
of &ldquo;Tristan&rdquo; was making no progress. Thus
Wagner deceived himself, and wore a mask for
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_43" title="43"> </a>others. He had too much routine, and his composing-machinery
was thrown out of gear, just
when a tangle formed in the mesh which only
inspiration could unloose. True, Wagner found
the clew when he succeeded in throwing off routine;
but had he really never possessed it, he would have
declared the fact without bitterness. And, after
all, this sentence in Wagner's letter expresses the
true artist-contempt for routine, inasmuch as he
waives all claim to a qualification which he thinks
meanly of, and takes care that others may not
invest him with it. This self-praise he utters with
a mien of ironic desperation. He is, in very truth,
unhappy that composition is at a standstill, but
finds rich consolation in the consciousness that his
genius is above the cheap expedients of routine;
at the same time, with an air of modesty, he
sorrowfully confesses that he has not acquired a
training belonging to the craft.</p>

<p>The sentence is a masterpiece of the native
cunning of the instinct of self-preservation; but
equally proves&mdash;and that is our point&mdash;the pettiness
of routine in creative work.</p>

<div class="description">RESPECT THE PIANOFORTE!</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Respect</span> the Pianoforte! Its disadvantages
are evident, decided, and unquestionable:
The lack of sustained tone, and the pitiless,
unyielding adjustment of the inalterable semitonic
scale.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_44" title="44"> </a>
But its advantages and prerogatives approach
the marvelous.</p>

<p>It gives a single man command over something
complete; in its potentialities from softest to
loudest in one and the same register it excels all
other instruments. The trumpet can blare, but
not sigh; contrariwise the flute; the pianoforte can
do both. Its range embraces the highest and
deepest practicable tones. Respect the Pianoforte!</p>

<p>Let doubters consider how the pianoforte was
esteemed by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Liszt, who
dedicated their choicest thoughts to it.</p>

<p>And the pianoforte has one possession wholly
peculiar to itself, an inimitable device, a photograph
of the sky, a ray of moonlight&mdash;the Pedal.</p>

<p>The effects of the pedal are unexhausted, because
they have remained even to this day the drudges
of a narrow-souled and senseless harmonic theory;
the treatment accorded them is like trying to
mould air or water into geometric forms. Beethoven,
who incontestably achieved the greatest
progress on and for the pianoforte, divined the
mysteries of the pedal, and to him we owe the
first liberties.</p>

<p>The pedal is in ill-repute. For this, absurd
irregularities must bear the blame. Let us experiment
with <em>sensible</em> irregularities.</p>

<p>This remarkable man's mental conceptions, lost in visionary

<p><a name="Footnote_R" href="#FNanchor_R" class="label">[R]</a> As if anticipating my thoughts, M. Vincent d'Indy has
just written me: &ldquo;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&hellip;&nbsp;laissant de c√¥t√© les contingences

<p><a name="Footnote_S" href="#FNanchor_S" class="label">[S]</a> I think I have read, somewhere, that Liszt confined his
Dante Symphony to the two movements, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Inferno</i> and
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Purgatorio</i>, &ldquo;because our tone-speech is inadequate to express
the felicities of Paradise.&rdquo;</p>
